# The Roofstock onChain Platform

Roofstock onChain is a dedicated **web3 business unit** that is building a blockchain enabled ecosystem to facilitate frictionless home ownership and radically simplify how single-family residential properties are bought and sold.&#x20;

**The Home Ownership Token (HOT) Standard:** Since SFR properties are real world assets, in order to participate as an approved issuer on the platform, the tokenized properties will need to conform to Roofstock's Home Ownership Token (HOT) standard.&#x20;

The HOT standard ensures that any HOT (on-chain asset) is always in sync with both the LLC and the underlying property (off-chain Real World Assets). Approved issuers who conform to the HOT standard will be able to create and offer and their HOT Property collections for sale on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. The Roofstock HOT Property collection will initially include properties sourced, acquired, renovated and tokenized by Roofstock. In the future, we are&#x20;

Properties conforming to the HOT Standard can be listed by approved sellers as collections of HOT Properties on the Roofstock onChain marketplace, subject to a recent inspection, valuation and other pertinent data.

**Roofstock onChain Marketplace**: The Roofstock onChain marketplace aims to allow frictionless purchase and sale of tokenized single-family residential (SFR) properties.&#x20;

1. **Collections**: Collections are HOT Properties whose smart contracts are based on the HOT ERC-721 standard. Issuers can apply to be approved by Roofstock to sell HOT Property collections on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. Collections will need the following attributes: Name, Smart Contract Address, image and Description.
2. **Home Ownership Tokens**: The tokens that are minted on HOT Standard based smart contracts are designated as Home Ownership Tokens. Each HOT should include a metadata endpoint that includes metadata about the underlying asset. The metadata will need to be based on the HOT metadata standard. Approved users who own tokens on the contract can add their token(s) to the marketplace. The metadata will automatically be loaded from the token to show the listing information.
3. **Metadata**: All HOT will need to have metadata that conforms to the rich metadata standard for Home Ownership Tokens. The existing ERC-721 metadata specification only supports a subset of the fields we would need for a tokenized single family residential property listing. While the  existing spec does permit key/value pairs for the attributes field, but it would be cumbersome to support all the fields required in this fashion. The HOT metadata standard helps streamline and organize the meta data needed for HOT listings. The HOT metadata standard is described under the HOT Standard section.
4. **Data room**: All HOT will need to have documents organized compliant to the HOT data room standard. The HOT data room standard is described under the HOT Standard section.

**Access to an off-chain ecosystem**: Roofstock is established in 70+ residential markets and has relationships with contractors, property managers, insurance providers etc., HOT Owners will have the option to leverage these relationships from Roofstock's off-chain SFR ecosystem.&#x20;

1. **Access to Agent Network:** Buyers who want to purchase and tokenize a specific property can leverage Roofstock network of agents (and in-house transaction coordinators) who can help with the purchase and tokenization process.
2. **Access to local property managers**: Roofstock has relationships with local and regional property managers in 70+ markets. HOT Owners can opt in to use any of these managers for property management services
3. **Access to Property Insurance**: HOT Owners can opt in to use Roofstock's partnership with Obie for property insurance requirements.

**Access to DeFi lending pools**: The Roofstock onChain platform is working on setting up relationships with DeFi lending protocols that will allow some HOT owners (restricted to rental properties for now) to be able to receive on-chain leverage using their HOT as collateral (without requiring credit underwriting of the HOT purchaser).&#x20;

**On-chain and off-chain liquidity options**: HOT Owners will have the ability to list their tokens for sale in the Roofstock onChain marketplace (subject to updated inspection and valuation, as the underlying property is a real world asset) or redeem their tokens and receive off-chain LLC or property ownership to avail liquidity through traditional means.

**Strong web3 community**: Roofstock onChain's goal is to become the platform for tokenized single family residential properties. As a part of this goal, we are building a strong web3 community that will have the opportunity to vote on various proposals and help chart the evolution of the platform.

1. **Discord**: The Roofstock onChain Discord server is an avenue for like minded people (from both traditional real estate and web3) to get together and discuss all matters pertaining to real estate and crypto. Our goal is to create a community where both the real estate and the web3/crypto ecosystem can learn from each other and grow together.
2. **Voting and governance**: We strongly believe that our community should have a say in the direction of how the Roofstock onChain platform evolves and how/where/what we purchase and tokenize to sell in the marketplace. We expect to have informal polls or formal voting on snapshot.org on proposals pertaining to these types of decisions.&#x20;
