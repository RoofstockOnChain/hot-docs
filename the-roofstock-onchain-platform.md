# The Roofstock onChain Platform

Roofstock onChain is a dedicated **web3 business unit** that is building a blockchain enabled ecosystem to facilitate frictionless home ownership and radically simplify how single-family residential properties are bought and sold.&#x20;

**The Home Ownership Token (HOT) Standard:** Since SFR properties are real world assets, in order to participate as an approved issuer on the platform, the tokenized properties will need to conform to Roofstock's Home Ownership Token (HOT) standard.&#x20;

The HOT standard ensures that any HOT (on-chain asset) is always in sync with both the LLC and the underlying property (off-chain Real World Assets). Approved issuers who conform to the HOT standard will be able to create and offer and their HOT Property collections for sale on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. The Roofstock HOT Property collection will initially include properties sourced, acquired, renovated and tokenized by Roofstock. In the future, we are&#x20;

Properties conforming to the HOT Standard can be listed by approved sellers as collections of HOT Properties on the Roofstock onChain marketplace, subject to a recent inspection, valuation and other pertinent data.

**Roofstock onChain Marketplace**: The Roofstock onChain marketplace aims to allow frictionless purchase and sale of tokenized single-family residential (SFR) properties.&#x20;

**Access to an off-chain ecosystem**: Roofstock is established in 70+ residential markets and has relationships with contractors, property managers, insurance providers etc., HOT Owners will have the option to leverage these relationships from Roofstock's off-chain SFR ecosystem.&#x20;

**Access to DeFi lending pools**: The Roofstock onChain platform is working on setting up relationships with DeFi lending protocols that will allow some HOT owners (restricted to rental properties for now) to be able to receive on-chain leverage using their HOT as collateral (without requiring credit underwriting of the HOT purchaser).&#x20;

**On-chain and off-chain liquidity options**: HOT Owners will have the ability to list their tokens for sale in the Roofstock onChain marketplace (subject to updated inspection and valuation, as the underlying property is a real world asset) or redeem their tokens and receive off-chain LLC or property ownership to avail liquidity through traditional means.

**Strong web3 community**: Roofstock onChain's goal is to become the platform for tokenized single family residential properties. As a part of this goal, we are building a strong web3 community that will have the opportunity to vote on various proposals and help chart the evolution of the platform.&#x20;
