# Ownership and Management Rights

**Ownership Rights**

HOT owners will have all the rights associated with traditional property ownership, including the following:&#x20;

1. **Property use**: HOT Properties may be used as primary residences, vacation homes, used for  personal or family use, as short-term or long-term rentals. (They may even be left vacant.)&#x20;
2. **Active management**: HOT Properties can be self-managed, or HOT owners can choose and direct a property manager to manage the property on their behalf.
   * **Self-managed HOT Property**: If a HOT owner chooses to self-manage the HOT Property, they will be provided with the keys (physical or smart lock). The HOT owner will be responsible for the payment of all property expenses (taxes, insurance, HOA, utilities, repairs & maintenance, and capital expenditure). Roofstock offers a free app that helps single-family residential landlords with financial reporting, and which will be offered to HOT owners as well.&#x20;
   * **Manager-managed HOT Property**: If a HOT Property is managed by a property manager, the owner will have the right to select and hire the property manager, and to terminate any property management arrangement at their discretion. The HOT owner will be provided with a list of approved property managers and will have the right to select the manager for their HOT Property. In this scenario, Roofstock may play a “concierge” role to interface with the property manager, as described in more detail below.&#x20;
3. **Taking Title to HOT Properties**: HOT owners will have the right to instruct Roofstock to terminate the LLC and to transfer title to the underlying property to the name of the individual HOT owner.&#x20;

**Roofstock’s Role as Administrator**&#x20;

Given that Home Ownership Tokens are tokenized versions of real-world assets, the token is inseparable from the associated LLC, which in turn is inseparable from the underlying single-family residential property. Thus, HOT owners will not be able to engage in activities that allow the off-chain assets (the LLC and the property) and the on-chain asset (Home Ownership Token) to go out of sync. Restricted activities include (but are not limited to):

1\. Getting loans, pledging the assets or creating other forms of liens or encumbrances on the off-chain assets.

2\. sale of the property or membership interest in the associated LLC separately from the associated Home Ownership Tokens.

3\. Certain administrative functions like minting, transfers and burning of tokens.&#x20;

These administrative activities will be restricted to the Administrator. The token holder however will always have the right to redeem the HOT and take control of the underlying LLC and property.

Although the LLC itself will be "Member Managed" (meaning that the member has the ultimate authority on managing the Property associated with the LLC), HOT owners will need to designate Roofstock to act as the administrator of the LLC and the associated Home Ownership Token, performing the following functions: &#x20;

* **Conducting KYC/AML**: The administrator will perform KYC/AML checks on all potential HOT owners before they are permitted to acquire Home Ownership Tokens. This will ensure that HOT Properties are not used for money laundering, funding terrorism, illegal or fraudulent activities. Once a prospective buyer is approved, they will be added to an approved identity registry. Additionally, Roofstock may also use a wallet screening service such as Elliptic Lens (https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening) for screening crypto wallets to prevent money laundering, comply with sanctions, and to combat fraud. &#x20;
* **LLC Administration Responsibilities**: The administrator will be responsible for the creation and ongoing maintenance of each LLC, including: paying annual LLC fees; ensuring a local process agent is in place; (optionally) interfacing with counterparties such as insurers and utility companies; providing accounting and financial reporting for the LLC; and treasury management (e.g., assisting in estimating reserves for future capex, managing debt payments to lenders, coordinating payment of property taxes, etc.).&#x20;
* **“Concierge” Services**: If the HOT owner decides to use the services of a property manager to manage the HOT Property, Roofstock will provide concierge services for the property, which may include: coordinating with third party property managers on property related issues; managing the payment of property taxes, insurance and HOA fees; allocating rent collections; and providing standardized reports regarding repair and maintenance history, financial records, etc. &#x20;
* **Token Administration Responsibilities**: The administrator will manage all token administration functions such as minting, approving transfers, initiating clawbacks, burning tokens, etc.  &#x20;

The administrator will surface relevant information to the HOT owner and take instruction from the HOT owner through Roofstock’s web-based app or dashboard. &#x20;
