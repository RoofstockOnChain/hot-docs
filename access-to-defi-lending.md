# Access to DeFi Lending

Traditional lending for single-family residential properties is complex, time consuming and expensive. It involves working with loan officers and underwriters at banks or specialty lenders. Additionally, based on FNMA guidelines, many lenders restrict the number of loans an individual can take, for their rental properties.

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) provides an opportunity for asset-based loans. The DeFi market has historically focused on lending against cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH etc. Recently we have started seeing an emergence of DeFi lending products focusing on lending to off-chain and real world assets.&#x20;

A key benefit of tokenizing single family homes is that it enables a new form of over collateralized asset based single-family residential lending. Instead of going through the lengthy traditional underwriting process, HOT owners may have the ability to pledge their tokens as collateral for an interest-only loan from a lending facility through one or more DeFi lending pools. Roofstock is currently in discussions with DeFi lending protocols to enable lending on tokenized real estate. When such a lending solution become available, it may be administered by Roofstock or other unaffiliated third-party acting in the capacity of a loan administrator or lending pool delegate.&#x20;

The HOT Loan Aggregator takes HOT as collateral and issues ERC-20 HOT Collateral Tokens (HCT)  that is used as collateral with the DeFi Lender or Lending Pool. This allows for pooling and aggregation of the HOT loans.

As discussed previously, because the underlying assets are real-world assets, it is imperative to keep certain aspects of the off-chain and on-chain ecosystem in sync. When properties are tokenized as HOT Properties, they are required to have clear and marketable title (no liens or encumbrances). This allows the functioning of the on-chain ecosystem (e.g., DeFi lending based on the token as collateral). While the HOT owner will be restricted from performing certain activities that may put the token out of sync with the real world assets. However the HOT owner will always have the management authority to unwind their LLC from this structure. This will require that they payoff any debt and accrued liabilities.

Any loans made in connection with HOT Properties will be treated as commercial loans, with the ownership interest in the LLC (i.e., the token) serving as collateral. This program will only be available to HOT Properties that are being used as rental properties. Due to mortgage lending licensing requirements, this service will not be available to HOT owners that are owner occupants or using the underlying property for personal or family use. The HOT owner will be required to sign a business purpose affidavit explaining their intended use of the HOT Property as a rental property.&#x20;

The lending facility may initially be capitalized using Roofstockâ€™s balance sheet with the goal to eventually be replaced or supplemented with outside capital DeFi sources. &#x20;
