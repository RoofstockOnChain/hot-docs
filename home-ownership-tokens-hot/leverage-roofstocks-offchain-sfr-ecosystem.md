# Leverage Roofstock's offchain SFR Ecosystem

**Ownership and Management Rights** &#x20;

HOT owners will have all the rights associated with traditional property ownership, including the following:&#x20;

* Property use: HOT Properties may be used as primary residences, vacation homes, used for other personal or family use, as short-term or long-term rentals. (They may even be left vacant.)&#x20;
* Property management: HOT Properties can be self-managed, or they can be managed by a property manager. &#x20;
* Self-managed HOT Property: If a HOT owner chooses to self-manage the HOT Property, they will be provided with the keys (physical or smart lock). The HOT owner will be responsible for the payment of all property expenses (taxes, insurance, HOA, utilities, repairs & maintenance, and capital expenditure). Roofstock offers a free app that helps single-family residential landlords with financial reporting, and which will be offered to HOT owners as well.&#x20;
* Manager-managed HOT Property: If a HOT Property is managed by a property manager, the owner will have the right to select and hire the property manager, and to terminate any property management arrangement at their discretion. The HOT owner will be provided with a list of approved property managers and will have the right to select the manager for their HOT Property. In this scenario, Roofstock may play a “concierge” role to interface with the property manager, as described in more detail below.&#x20;
* Taking Title to HOT Properties: HOT owners will have the right to instruct Roofstock to terminate the LLC and to transfer title to the underlying property to the name of the individual HOT owner.&#x20;

**Roofstock’s Role as Administrator**&#x20;

Given that Home Ownership Tokens are tokenized versions of real-world assets, the token is inseparable from the associated LLC, which in turn is inseparable from the underlying single-family residential property. Thus, HOT owners will not be able to sell their Home Ownership Tokens separately from the membership \[beneficial] interest in the associated LLC, and certain administrative functions like minting, transfers and burning of tokens will be restricted to the administrator. &#x20;

Roofstock will act as the administrator of both the LLC and the Home Ownership Tokens, performing the following functions: &#x20;

* Conducting KYC/AML: The administrator will perform KYC/AML checks on all potential HOT owners before they are permitted to acquire Home Ownership Tokens. This will ensure that HOT Properties are not used for money laundering, funding terrorism, illegal or fraudulent activities. Once a prospective buyer is approved, they will be added to an approved identity registry. Additionally, Roofstock may also use a wallet screening service such as Elliptic Lens (https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening) for screening crypto wallets to prevent money laundering, comply with sanctions, and to combat fraud. &#x20;
* LLC Administration Responsibilities: The administrator will be responsible for the creation and ongoing maintenance of each LLC, including: paying annual LLC fees; ensuring a local process agent is in place; interfacing with counterparties such as insurers and utility companies; providing accounting and financial reporting for the LLC; and treasury management (e.g., assisting in estimating reserves for future capex, managing debt payments to lenders, coordinating payment of property taxes, etc.). &#x20;
* “Concierge” Services: If the HOT owner decides to use the services of a property manager to manage the HOT Property, Roofstock will provide concierge services for the property, which may include: coordinating with third party property managers on property related issues; managing the payment of property taxes, insurance and HOA fees; allocating rent collections; and providing standardized reports regarding repair and maintenance history, financial records, etc. &#x20;
* Token Administration Responsibilities: The administrator will manage all token administration functions such as minting, approving transfers, initiating clawbacks, burning tokens, etc. &#x20;

The administrator will surface relevant information to the HOT owner and take instruction from the HOT owner through Roofstock’s web-based app or dashboard. &#x20;

HOT owners will not be required to engage Roofstock to do the foregoing activities; however, certain ancillary services in the HOT ecosystem may only be available to those that choose to work with Roofstock. For instance, insurers and lenders in the ecosystem may require a single counterparty (Roofstock) and standardized reporting structure (such as the one provided by Roofstock) in order to use their services.&#x20;
