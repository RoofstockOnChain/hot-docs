# Buy a Home Ownership Token

This option is the fastest and simplest way to acquire a Home Ownership Token. Potential buyers can simply review tokenized properties for sale on the Roofstock onChain marketplace, where they have instant access to all of the information that could be needed by any property buyer: a copy of the deed, recent inspection and appraisal reports, a data room showing all of the key information relating to the house, records of property tax payments, insurance documents, etc. Additionally, if the home is currently tenanted, the rent-roll pertaining to the lease will be available. If the home is not tenanted, estimated market rents will be provided. &#x20;

In the future, approved third-parties may be allowed to list collections of their HOT Properties (properties meeting the HOT Standard) in the Roofstock onChain marketplace as well. This platform approach will allow us to create a  HOT marketplace comprising of many sellers and buyers.&#x20;

Separately, for institutions that desire to purchase multiple homes, or even entire portfolios of homes, in the form of tokens, Roofstock will offer a bespoke option for such buyers.&#x20;
