# On-chain Lending Solution

A key benefit of tokenizing single family homes is that it enables a new form of over collateralized asset based single-family residential lending. Instead of going through the lengthy traditional underwriting process, whether to acquire an initial loan or refinance an existing one, HOT owners may have the ability to pledge their tokens as collateral for an interest-only loan from a lending facility that will be modeled on the principles of DeFi lending pools. Should such a lending solution become available, it may be administered by Roofstock or other unaffiliated third-party (TradFi or DeFi) acting in the capacity of a loan administrator or lending pool delegate.&#x20;

Any loans made in connection with HOT Properties will be treated as commercial loans, with the ownership interest in the LLC (i.e., the token) serving as collateral. This program will only be available to HOT Properties that are being used as rental properties. Due to mortgage lending licensing requirements, this service will not be available to HOT owners that are owner occupants or using the underlying property for personal or family use. The HOT owner will be required to sign a business purpose affidavit explaining their intended use of the HOT Property as a rental property.&#x20;

The lending facility may initially be capitalized using Roofstockâ€™s balance sheet with the goal to eventually be replaced or supplemented with outside capital from TradFi or DeFi sources. &#x20;
