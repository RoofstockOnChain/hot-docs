# On-chain Lending Solution

A key benefit of tokenizing single family homes is that it enables a new form of over collateralized asset based single-family residential lending. Instead of going through the lengthy traditional underwriting process, whether to acquire an initial loan or refinance an existing one, HOT owners can opt to simply pledge their tokens as collateral for an interest-only loan from a lending facility operated by Roofstock. HOT owners will be able to pledge their tokens to a lender as collateral and access instantaneous credit on the blockchain. This lending mechanism will be modeled on the principles of DeFi lending pools and will be designed and managed by Roofstock specifically for the HOT ecosystem.&#x20;

Roofstock will operate a lending facility that sources debt capital and deploys it to HOT owners. The loans will be made as commercial loans, with the ownership interest in the LLC (i.e., the token) serving as collateral, and loans will only be available to HOT Properties that are being used as rental properties that are managed by a third-party property manager. This will allow the lender to underwrite the loan based on the underlying property, knowing that Roofstock will be able to direct payments to the lender and provide reliable financial reporting. Due to mortgage lending licensing requirements, this service will only be available to HOT owners that are not owner occupants. The HOT owner will be required to sign a business purpose affidavit explaining their intended use of the HOT Property as a rental property.&#x20;

The lending facility will initially be capitalized using Roofstockâ€™s balance sheet with the goal to eventually be replaced or supplemented with outside capital from TradFi or DeFi sources. &#x20;
