# On-Chain and off-chain Liquidity Options

When the HOT owner is ready to divest their Home Ownership Token, they have both on-chain and off-chain options:&#x20;

**On-chain Liquidity**

Hot owners will have the option to receive an offer from a Roofstock-sponsored buyer (aka “liquidity pool”): This mechanism is modeled on the principles of DeFi liquidity pools, reimagined specifically for the HOT ecosystem and real-world properties. This model will incorporate both data and in-person visits to arrive at a fair offer at a price calculated in accordance with predetermined valuation criteria. If the HOT owner is happy with this price, she can accept the offer with one click and instantly receive payment without any of the traditional real estate transaction processes or expenses. &#x20;

This “liquidity pool” will initially be capitalized by Roofstock’s balance sheet with the goal to eventually be replaced or supplemented with outside capital. &#x20;

Home Ownership Tokens repurchased by the “liquidity pool” will be re-listed for sale in the HOT Property marketplace, whether tenanted or untenanted.&#x20;

**Off-chain Liquidity:**&#x20;

HOT owners will also have traditional real-estate liquidity options.

* Burn the HOT and retain ownership of the LLC: The underlying property continues to be titled with the LLC, but the LLC but Roofstock ceases to be associated with the LLC and the underlying property. The associated Home Ownership Token will be burnt.&#x20;
* Redeem the HOT and take title to the underlying property: HOT owners may ask Roofstock to redeem the HOT Property associated with the Home Ownership Token. This will result in a transfer of title of the underlying property from the LLC. The LLC will be terminated, and the associated token will be burned.&#x20;

These on-chain and off-chain liquidity alternatives provide  HOT Owners absolute control over the disposition of the property, independent of Roofstock.&#x20;
