# On-Chain and off-chain Liquidity

When the HOT owner is ready to divest their Home Ownership Token, they may have both on-chain and off-chain options:&#x20;

**On-chain Liquidity**

Hot owners will be able to list their tokens for sale on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. Since the HOT is tied to a real-world asset, Roofstock will require recent property inspection and valuation prior to the listing going live. HOT owners will be able to review any offers and accept, reject or counter them. If they accept an offer, they will be able to settle the sale on-chain without any of the traditional real estate transaction processes or expenses.

**Off-chain Liquidity:**&#x20;

HOT owners will also have traditional real-estate liquidity options.

* Burn the HOT and retain ownership of the LLC: The underlying property continues to be titled with the LLC, but the LLC but Roofstock ceases to be associated with the LLC and the underlying property. The associated Home Ownership Token will be burnt.&#x20;
* Redeem the HOT and take title to the underlying property: HOT owners may ask Roofstock to redeem the HOT Property associated with the Home Ownership Token. This will result in a transfer of title of the underlying property from the LLC. The LLC will be terminated, and the associated token will be burned.&#x20;

These on-chain and off-chain liquidity alternatives provide  HOT Owners absolute control over the disposition of the property, independent of Roofstock.&#x20;
