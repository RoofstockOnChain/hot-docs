# Home Ownership Tokens (HOT)

**Overview**&#x20;

Roofstock proposes to abstract away the complexity, time and cost of engaging in traditional real estate transactions by titling each single-family residential property in a single purpose limited liability company (LLC). The membership interest of the LLC is “tokenized” on the Ethereum blockchain using a modified ERC-721 standard. The modified ERC-721 standard is defined as part of the [HOT standard](../the-hot-standard/) and properties tokenized through this structure as “HOT Properties.”&#x20;

Because the LLC is the legal owner of the property, and the Home Ownership Token represents the uncertificated ownership of the LLC, HOT owners are able to purchase and sell HOTs in a one-click online transaction, without removing the underlying property from the associated LLC. &#x20;

**Utility value and Active Management**

Given the securities regulations in the United States, most tokenized real estate projects, commercial or residential, when fractionalized, will likely be considered securities. In our view, there is only one class of real estate assets that is generally suitable for tokenization without being deemed a security: single family residential properties.  &#x20;

The main distinction from a securities analysis perspective arises from the fact that single family residences have:

a. **utility value** that can be realized by the owner: single-family residential properties can serve as the owner’s full-time or vacation residence, and&#x20;

b. they can be **actively managed** by the owner or at the direction of the owner. Even when the owner uses third party property managers for performing administrative management functions, they are still involved in the active management of the asset (e.g., setting the rent, reviewing and approving any repairs and capital expenditure). This distinguishes ownership of single-family residential from commercial properties such as retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, warehouse and so on, which are generally much more expensive (and thus offered for sale by a sponsor, and distributed to a group of investors), offer no real possibility for the underlying property to be used for personal use, and/or to be managed actively by a single owner, rather than by the sponsor or its affiliates.&#x20;

**How to become a HOT Owner**

Customers have several ways to become HOT owners: &#x20;

1. **Purchase a HOT Property** from one of the collections on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. The Collections may be offered by Roofstock or other approved sellers. This is the easiest way to acquire a HOT, as the underlying properties are already tokenized and on-chain. Buyers can simply review tokenized properties for sale on the Roofstock onChain marketplace along with all the pertinent documentation in the data room: a copy of the deed, recent inspection and appraisal reports, all of the key information relating to the house, including property taxes, insurance, etc. Additionally, if the home is currently tenanted, the rent-roll pertaining to the lease will be available. If the home is not tenanted, estimated market rents will be provided. &#x20;
2. **Onboard an unencumbered property** as a Home Ownership Token: Mint a Home Ownership Token for a property they already own. This process will require the creation of an LLC and an on-ramp of the real-world asset into a tokenized asset. Although this does not require real-estate agents, the initial on-ramp will involve a traditional title and transfer process.&#x20;
3. **Ask Roofstock to help acquire and tokenize** a specific property for them. This is the lengthiest process, as we will need to work with a real-estate agent on making offers and using the traditional real estate closing process to close the property before tokenization. Roofstock will purchase the home and manage the closing process. As part of this process, it will create a new, single purpose LLC, title the home in the name of the LLC and, following closing, tokenize the LLC interest. Once the home has been purchased and tokenized, the buyer will be able to acquire the HOT.&#x20;

Options 2 and 3 offer ways to enter the HOT ecosystem. However, given that these necessarily involve some of the traditional aspects of real estate closings, they will not be “one click” transactions. Roofstock has successfully closed tens of thousands of home purchases and sales and can leverage its extensive expertise to ensure these are completed as expediently as possible. &#x20;

The HOT standard ensures that any HOT (on-chain asset) is always in sync with both the LLC and the underlying property (off-chain Real World Assets).&#x20;

HOT owners have complete freedom when it comes to what they want to do with the underlying property.  they can live in the property, let a friend or family member use it (personal or family use), use it as a vacation property, a short-term rental, or a long-term rental.

Since the HOT owner makes all decisions pertaining to their property, there is no guarantee that they will receive income or profits from the ownership of the property. Their choices — in terms of how to use the property and who, if anyone, helps her manage it — directly determines any financial return. If the management of the property is delegated to a property manager, the HOT owner decides which property manager to use and their level of involvement in ongoing issues pertaining to tenancy, operating expenses, capital expenditure and other related matters. Thus, any profits generated involve active participation on the part of the HOT owner and do not solely depend on a promoter or any other third party.&#x20;

HOT owners can use both crypto currencies (BTC, ETH or stable coins like USDC and DAI) or fiat (ACH or wire) as funding sources. If cryptocurrency is used as a funding source, the wallet may be subject to additional scrutiny using a tool like Elliptic Lens (https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening) to ensure that none of the funds have questionable origins or come from illicit activities. Liquidity Options: It is also worth noting that all buyers will be required to undergo KYC/AML checks. &#x20;
