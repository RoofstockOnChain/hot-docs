# Home Ownership Tokens (HOT)

**Overview**&#x20;

Given the securities regulations in the United States, most tokenized real estate projects, commercial or residential, when fractionalized, will likely be considered securities. In our view, there is only one class of real estate assets that is generally suitable for tokenization without being deemed a security: single family residential properties.  &#x20;

The main distinction from a securities analysis perspective arises from the fact that single family residences have&#x20;

a. utility value that can be realized by the owner: single-family residential properties can serve as the owner’s full-time or vacation residence, and&#x20;

b. they can be actively managed by the owner or at the direction of the owner. Even when the owner uses third party property managers for performing administrative management functions, they are still involved in the active management of the asset (e.g., setting the rent, reviewing and approving any repairs and capital expenditure). This distinguishes ownership of single-family residential from commercial properties such as retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, warehouse and so on, which are generally much more expensive (and thus offered for sale by a sponsor, and distributed to a group of investors), offer no real possibility for the underlying property to be used for personal use, and/or to be managed actively by a single owner, rather than by the sponsor or its affiliates.&#x20;

Customers have several ways to become HOT owners: &#x20;

1. Purchase a HOT Property from one of the collections on the Roofstock onChain marketplace. The Collections may be offered by Roofstock or other approved sellers. This is the easiest way to acquire a HOT, as the underlying properties are already tokenized and on-chain.
2. Onboard an unencumbered property as a Home Ownership Token: Mint a Home Ownership Token for a property they already own. This process will require an on-ramp of the real-world asset into a tokenized asset and will involved a traditional title and transfer process.&#x20;
3. As Roofstock to help acquire and tokenize a specific property for them. This is the lengthiest process, as we will need to work with a real-estate agent on making offers and using the traditional real estate closing process to close the property before tokenization.

HOT owners have complete freedom when it comes to what they want to do with the underlying property.  they can live in the property, let a friend or family member use it (personal or family use), use it as a vacation property, a short-term rental, or a long-term rental.

Since the HOT owner makes all decisions pertaining to their property, there is no guarantee that they will receive income or profits from the ownership of the property. Their choices — in terms of how to use the property and who, if anyone, helps her manage it — directly determines any financial return. If the management of the property is delegated to a property manager, the HOT owner decides which property manager to use and their level of involvement in ongoing issues pertaining to tenancy, operating expenses, capital expenditure and other related matters. Thus, any profits generated involve active participation on the part of the HOT owner and do not solely depend on a promoter or any other third party.&#x20;

HOT owners can use both crypto currencies (BTC, ETH or stable coins like USDC and DAI) or fiat (ACH or wire) as funding sources. If cryptocurrency is used as a funding source, the wallet may be subject to additional scrutiny using a tool like Elliptic Lens (https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening) to ensure that none of the funds have questionable origins or come from illicit activities. Liquidity Options: It is also worth noting that all buyers will be required to undergo KYC/AML checks. &#x20;
