# Home Ownership Tokens (HOT)

**Overview**&#x20;

Given the securities regulations in the United States, most tokenized real estate projects, commercial or residential, when fractionalized, will likely be considered securities. In our view, there is only one class of real estate assets that is generally suitable for tokenization without being deemed a security: single family residential properties.  &#x20;

The main distinction from a securities analysis perspective arises from the fact that single family residences have utility value that can be realized by the owner. Single-family residential properties can serve as the owner’s full-time or vacation residence, and they can be managed directly by the owner without involving third parties. Even when the owner used third party property managers for performing administrative management functions, they are still involved in the active management of the asset (e.g., setting the rent, reviewing and approving any repairs and capital expenditure). This distinguishes ownership of single-family residential from commercial properties such as retail, office, multifamily, hospitality, warehouse and so on, which are generally much more expensive (and thus offered for sale by a sponsor, and distributed to a group of investors), offer no real possibility for the underlying property to be used for personal use, and/or to be managed actively by a single owner, rather than by the sponsor or its affiliates.&#x20;

When a potential customer visits Roofstock’s Home Ownership Token website, they have several options: &#x20;

1. Onboard a property as a Home Ownership Token: Mint a Home Ownership Token for a property they already own; or bring a property they wish to acquire that Roofstock can acquire and tokenize for them.&#x20;
2. Buy a Home Ownership Token for a home that Roofstock has already sourced, acquired and renovated.&#x20;
3. Leverage Roofstock’s off-chain single-family residential ecosystem – owning and managing the underlying real property by connecting with local contractors, property managers etc.&#x20;
4. On-chain lending solution – by potentially being able to borrow against the Home Ownership Token if the property is used as a rental property.&#x20;
5. On-chain and off-chain Liquidity Options: Exit the HOT ecosystem, either by selling the HOT to to an i-Buyer at a price that is offered pursuant to a transparent pricing model or redeem the HOT and take title to the underlying property. &#x20;

This framework is powerful because it empowers the HOT owner to own her property in the way that that they see fit at every stage of the ownership lifecycle.  Live in your property, let a friend or family member use it, use it as a vacation property while occasionally renting it out, or find a long-term tenant. &#x20;

Since the HOT owner makes all decisions pertaining to their property, there is no guarantee that they will receive income or profits from the ownership of the property. Their choices — in terms of how to use the property and who, if anyone, helps her manage it — directly determine any financial return. If the management of the property is delegated to a property manager, the HOT owner decides which property manager to use and their level of involvement in ongoing issues pertaining to tenancy, operating expenses, capital expenditure and other related matters. Thus, any profits generated involve active participation on the part of the HOT owner and do not solely depend on a promoter or any other third party.&#x20;

HOT owners can use both crypto currencies (BTC, ETH or stable coins like USDC and DAI) or fiat (ACH or wire) as funding sources. If cryptocurrency is used as a funding source, the wallet may be subject to additional scrutiny using a tool like Elliptic Lens (https://www.elliptic.co/blog/lens-wallet-screening) to ensure that none of the funds have questionable origins or come from illicit activities. Liquidity Options: It is also worth noting that all buyers will be required to undergo KYC/AML checks. &#x20;
