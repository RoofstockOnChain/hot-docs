# Executive Summary

Single-family residential properties have traditionally been considered a core strategy for accumulating wealth and achieving the American dream. Over the last 15 years, single-family residential properties have proven their resilience through both the great recession of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, serving as a non-correlated, inflation-adjusted alternative to traditional public equity markets and crypto assets. Although homeownership (whether used as owner occupied or rental property) provides a mechanism for building long-term wealth, there are several challenges:

**High friction in purchasing homes**: Home buyers need to be knowledgeable about both the local market and the specific home they wish to purchase. The process of sourcing, performing diligence and selecting a potential home involves significant time and expertise, and usually requires a trusted and reliable network of real estate agents, contractors, property managers (if used as a rental property) and so on. While there are tech-forward real estate platforms that make this process easier, the traditional process of purchasing a home still involves multiple intermediaries, and the entire process takes weeks to complete. This pain point is even more acute for purchasers of remote properties. Although residents in many metropolitan areas and coastal cities find themselves priced out of the areas in which they live, they may still be able to access the benefits of home ownership by purchasing a property in another geography for use as a rental or vacation home.

**High transaction costs**: Residential real estate transactions involve high costs, which frequently equate to 5-10% of the value of the property. For example, the sale of a $200,000 property could involve 6% in real estate commissions ($12,000), 1% in closing costs ($2,000), variable property rehabilitation costs ($5,000 for illustrative purposes) and opportunity cost of lost rent if the property was used as a rental (3 months at $1,500 per month or $4,500 for illustrative purposes). The all-in cost could be $23,500, or over 10% of the sale price. Blockchain technology is uniquely suited to reduce high transaction costs that are paid to rent-seeking intermediaries by facilitating peer to peer transactions.

**Access to credit**: Traditional home loans are underwritten based on the borrower’s credit and income, even though the property itself serves as collateral to the loan. Personal credit scores and the debt-to-income (DTI) requirements have a significant impact on an individual’s ability to qualify for real estate loans. Additionally, for crypto native investors who may not have established relationships with the traditional banking and credit system, this becomes an even more significant challenge.
