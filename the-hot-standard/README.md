# The HOT Standard

We are developing the HOT standard for tokenized single family properties. These standards include:

a. Modified ERC-721 standard

b. Definition of the Metadata for HOT Properties

c. Data room requirements for HOT Properties, and&#x20;

d. Form agreements (e.g., LLC Agreement and Token Purchase Agreement)

Sellers approved by Roofstock and conforming to the HOT Standard will be able to list their HOT Collections on the Roofstock onChain marketplace.
