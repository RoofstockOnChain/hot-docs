# The HOT Standard

We are developing the HOT standard for tokenized single family properties. These standards include:

a. Modified ERC-721 standard

b. Definition of the Metadata for HOT Properties

c. Data room requirements for HOT Properties, and&#x20;

d. Form agreements (e.g., LLC Agreement and Token Purchase Agreement)

In the future, it is our goal to allow the Roofstock onChain platform to be used by approved token issuers who conform to the HOT Standard. Such issuers will be able to list and sell their HOT Property collections through our platform.
