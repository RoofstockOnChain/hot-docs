**What is home ownership?**&#x20;

For us, homeownership represents the ability to use a property as a full-time residence, vacation home, short-term or long-term rental. Technological improvements in recent years have provided home buyers the opportunity to purchase and own properties remotely - a field in which Roofstock has been a proud pioneer.&#x20;

**Why is home ownership important?**&#x20;

Home ownership has always been an important milestone for many people because it represents stability, independence, and an opportunity for generational wealth creation. &#x20;

**What are the challenges associated with traditional home ownership?**&#x20;

The traditional property purchase process involves multiple steps and several intermediaries. The diagrams below outline the high-level process and the key intermediaries involved. The process usually takes anywhere from 3-6 weeks from start to finish and involves high transaction costs.&#x20;

**Why purchase Home Ownership Tokens when you take title to the underlying property?**

A lot of people are looking to own single-family residential properties. However, many are daunted by the complexity of the overall process, the weeks, if not months it takes to source and acquire properties, and the high costs involved. Buyers are looking for simplicity, a frictionless process, one-click buying and selling experience — and one in which the traditional fees have been racially reduced. With Roofstock’s Home Ownership Tokens, the noise and bureaucracy of traditional real estate transactions are abstracted away. Additionally, once a home has been tokenized in Roofstock’s system, the token holder has access to additional streamlined ancillary services, such as home insurance, property management, reporting and so on. Rental property token holders may also be able to obtain a loan by pledging the token as collateral to a lender. Additionally, token holders may be eligible to receive an offer (subject to updated inspection or valuation reports) to sell back their token at any time in an i-Buyer type purchase (conceptually analogous to a liquidity pool).

**How is Roofstock Achieving Frictionless single-family residential Transactions?**&#x20;

In the United States, deeds to single-family residential properties are recorded with the county recorder where the property is located. In order to ensure that clear and marketable title to a property is being conveyed to the buyer, real estate transactions typically require title insurance policies that cover most common claims filed against a title, including outstanding liens, back taxes and conflicting wills. The deed recordation process and the associated paperwork make the typical real estate transaction time consuming and expensive.&#x20;

Roofstock proposes to abstract away this process by titling each single-family residential property in a single purpose limited liability company (LLC)]. The membership interest of the LLC is “tokenized” on the Ethereum blockchain using a modified ERC-721 standard. We refer to properties tokenized through this structure as “HOT Properties.”&#x20;

Because the LLC is the legal owner of the property, and the Home Ownership Token represents the uncertificated ownership of the LLC, HOT owners are able to purchase and sell HOTs in a one-click, online transaction, without removing the underlying property from the associated LLC. &#x20;

This allows fast and inexpensive transfers of HOT Properties without requiring new title insurance, deed recordation, and in some states, transfer taxes. &#x20;
